#| Review

The script below loads the scrap data from the X-drive, cleans the data to make it easier to use, and then saves the new table as a CSV file. Feel free to review to see what we did and copy any helpful snippets.

```{r clean-up-data, eval=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Read the original scrap data
scrap_full <- read_csv("X:/Agency_Files/Outcomes/Risk_Eval_Air_Mod/_Air_Risk_Evaluation/R/R_Camp/Intro to R/RTrain - Star Wars//data/starwars_scrap_jakku_full.csv")

#| Read cleaned scrap data

Today we'll read data from the `X-drive`.

```{r}
# Load packages
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read cleaned scrap data
clean_data  <-  read_csv("X:/Agency_Files/Outcomes/Risk_Eval_Air_Mod/_Air_Risk_Evaluation/R/R_Camp/Intro to R/RTrain - Star Wars/data/starwars_scrap_jakku_clean.csv")

# Get to know the data
names(clean_data)
glimpse(clean_data)
summary(clean_data)

```



#| `ggplot()`
<hr>

Diving deeper into making plots. 


## The `ggplot()` sandwich {-}
<hr>

![](images/auto_plot.gif){style="margin-top: -22px; max-width: 108%;"}

<span class="h6" style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;"> The 3 ingredients in a `ggplot` </span>


<br>

### 1. The base plot {-}

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data)
```

<br>

Remember to load the package!
```{r, eavl=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

<br>

### 2. The the X, Y _aesthetics_  {-}

The _aesthetics_ assign the components from the data that you want to use in the chart. These also determine the dimensions of the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price)) 
```


### 3. The layers or _geometries_  {-}

The geometries (abbreviated geom) are the things that actually fill the space. They are based on the aesthetics you provide in the `ggplot()` call by default; however, you can provide different aesthetics for each geometry if you need to.

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br><br>



### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
> When you add more layers using `+` remember to place it at the end of each line.

```{r, eval=F}
# This will work
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price)) +
  geom_point()

# So will this
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price)) + geom_point()

# But this won't
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price))
  + geom_point()

```



## Colors {-}
<hr>


Now let's use color to show the destinations of the scrap

<br>

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, color = destination)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>

### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
> An easy way to experiment with colors is to add layers like `scale_fill_brewer` or `scale_colour_brewer`
to your plot which will link to RcolorBrewer palettes so you can have accessible color schemes.

<br>

## Bar charts {-}

This is a too much detail. Let's make a bar chart and add up the sales to make it easier to understand. Note that we use fill in aes() instead of color. If we used color, we'd get a colorful outline and grey (or is it gray?) bars.

<br>

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col()
```

<br>

What if we want to make it easier to compare sales by destination for each origin? Let's change the position of the bars. Remember, you can use `help(geom_col)` to learn about different options for the function. You can do the same with any other `ggplot2` function.

<br>

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

<br>

## Facet wrap {-}

What if we want to make the chart less crowded? Let's use the `facet wrap` function to put each origin on a separate chart.

<br>

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination")
```

<br>


## Themes {-}

You may not like the appearance of these plots. `ggplot2` uses `theme` functions to change the appearance of a plot. Try some different themes out.

<br>

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw()
```

<br>

## Labels {-}

You can also change the axis and title labels using the `labs` function

<br>

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales")
```

<br>

## Drop scientific notation {-}

What if we want to get rid of that ugly scientific notation? We can use `options(scipen = 999)`. Note that this is a general setting in R and not part of the ggplot. Once you use `options(scipen = 999)` in your current session, you don't have to use it again (like loading a package, you need to run the line each time you start a new R session).

<br>


```{r}
options(scipen = 999)

ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales $$")
```

<br>

What if we don't like the zeros and want the labels in millions? Any ideas?

<br><br>


#### <i class="fa fa-starwars" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

We've covered how to do a scatterplot with `geom_point` and a bar chart with `geom_col`, but now we want to do a boxplot of the total price for each destination. But we're not telling you which function to use. You're on your own here. Feel free to add colors ,`facet_wrap`, `theme`, and `labs` to your boxplots. May the force be with you.

<br>


## Save plots {-}

You've (hopefully) had fun making all of these plots, so let's learn to save them so we can cherish them forever. There's a function called `ggsave` to do just that. How do we `ggsave` our plots? HELP! (no really, we can type `help(ggsave)`)

```{r ggsave, eval = F}
# Get help
help(ggsave)
?ggsave

# Copy and paste the r code of your favorite plot here
ggplot(data, aes()) +
   .... +
   ....


# Save your plot to a png file of your choosing
ggsave("your_results_folder/plot_name.png")
```


<br>


### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
> What if you don't want to save just the last plot you've made? Instead, you want to make a plot and save it for later. 

```{r ggsave objects, eval = F}

# The ggplot you want to save
my_plot <- ggplot(...)
  
# The name of the file the chart will be saved to.
where_to_save_it <- "___.png"

# Save it!
ggsave(filename = where_to_save_it, plot = my_plot)
```

<br>

In a future workshops we'll show how to create a ton of plots at once and save them all in a folder so you'll be able to generate a giant PDF book of all your beautiful plots. You could even make it into a book for your coffee table.

#| Questions 


<div style="font-size: 16px;">

- How to modify the gridlines behind your chart?
    - Try the different themes at the end of this lesson: `theme_light()` or `theme_bw()`.
    - Or modify the color and size with `theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.5))`.
    - There's even `theme_excel()`
- How do you set the x and y scale manually?
    - Here is an example with a scatter plot: `ggplot() + geom_point() + xlim(beginning, end) + ylim(beginning, end)`
    - __Warning:__ Values above or below the limits you set will not be shown. This is another great way to lie with data. 
- How do you get rid of the legend if you don't need it?
    - `geom_point(aes(color = facility_name), show.legend = FALSE)`
    - The R cookbook shows a number of ways to get rid of legends: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/
- I only like dashed lines. How do you change the linetype to a _dashed_ line? 
    - `geom_line(aes(color = facility_name), linetype = "dashed")`
    - You should also try `"dotted"` and `"dotdash"`, or maybe`"twodash"`
  
  
- How many colors are there in R? How does R know `hotpink` is a color?
    - There is an R color cheatsheet: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf 
    - As well as some basic color names here: http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names/
    - `library(viridis)` provides some great default color palettes for charts and maps.
    - This web tool will give you palette ideas and color Hex numbers: http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3
- What are some handy keyboard shortcuts in R? How do I find them?
    - There is a shortcut cheat sheet online: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf
    - Or in RStudio, you can go to _Help_ > _Keyboard Shortcuts Help_
