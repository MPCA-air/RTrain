### Get ready {-}

__Step 1:__ Power on your droid.  
__Step 2:__ Open RStudio.

<br><br><br><br>


#| New project
<hr>

Welcome to Jakku! You've arrived just in time. The Junk boss Unkar is being a meany-pants and has started skimping on rations. Plus Rey wants to make some upgrades to her speeder bike. Luckily for us, BB8 was able snag a transfer log from Unkar's droid that shows all of his recent shipments. Let's power on our Datapad and see if we canâ€™t make some trouble for Unkar, and while we're at it, find a great place to start hunting for recycled speeder parts.

<br>

__Start a new project__

- In _Rstudio_ select _File_ from the top menu bar
- Choose _New Project..._ > _New Directory_ > _New Project_
- Enter a project name such as `"junk data"`
- Select _Browse..._ and choose a folder where you store your data work. 
- Ignore the rest and click _Create Project_


## New R script

R _scripts_ are where you write your R code and document your work. They're like recipes or prescriptions you write the tell the computer what you want to happen to your data.

__Open new R script__

- In the upper left, click on the white file icon with the green (+) sign. 
- Select _R Script_.

![](http://docplayer.net/docs-images/25/5462802/images/10-0.png){width=450}

<br>

__Save script__

- Click on the floppy disk icon
- Enter a file name such as `starwars_code.R`


## A tour of R Studio

<img src="http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/images/rstudio.png" width="580">

<br>

__1. Code editor__ 

This is where you write your scripts and document your work. The tabs at the top of the code editor allow you to view scripts and data sets you have open. This is where you'll spend most of your time.
 
__2. Console__ 

This is where code is actually executed by the computer. It shows code that you have run and any errors, warnings, or other messages resulting from that code. You can input code directly into the console and run it, but it won't be saved for later. That's why we like to run all of our code directly from a script in the code editor.
 
__3. Workspace__ 

This pane shows all of the objects and functions that you have created, as well as a history of the code you have run during your current session. The environment tab shows all of your objects and functions. The history tab shows the code you have run. Note the _broom_ icon below the Connections tab. This cleans shop and allows you to clear all of the objects in your workspace.
 
__4. Plots and files__ 

These tabs allows you to view and open files in your current directory, view plots and other visual objects like maps, view your installed packages and their functions, and access the help window. If at anytime you're unsure what a function or package does, enter the name of thing after a question mark. For example, try entering `?mean` into the console and push __ENTER__.



## Make it your own
Let's add a little style so we feel more at home. Follow these steps to change the font-size and and color scheme: 

1. Go to __Tools__ on the top navigation bar. 
2. Choose `Global Options...`
3. Choose `Appearance` with the paint bucket.
4. Find something you like.

<br>

#| First steps
<hr>

You can create objects and assign values to them using the "left arrow" `<- `, and more officially known as the assignment operator. Try adding the code below to your R script and creating an object called `wookie`.

Once you add the code to your script, you can run the code by moving the blinking cursor to that line and pressing __CTRL + ENTER__.
```{r steps, eval = F}

# Create a new object
wookie <- "Chewbacca"

wookie


# When saving text to a character object you need quotation marks.
# This won't work.
wookie <- Chewbacca


# Without quotes, R looks for an object called Chewbacca, and then lets you know that it couldn't find one. 


# You can copy an object by saving it to a new name.
wookie2 <- wookie


# Or overwrite an object
wookie <- "Tarfful"
  
wookie


# Did the value stored in name2 change as well?
wookie2  

```


<br>

### Drop and remove data {-}

You can drop objects with the remove function `rm() `. Try it out on some of your wookies.

```{r, eval = F}

# Delete objects to clean-up your environment
rm(wookie)

rm(wookie2)


# How can you get the 'wookie' object back?
# Hint: The UP arrow is your friend.

```

<summary class = "btn_code_green"> **GOOD NEWS** Deleting data is okay</summary>
<p>

<div class="tip">
Don't worry about deleting data or making mistakes in R. When R loads data files it only copies the contents. All your original data files remain safe and won't suffer from any accidental changes. If something disappears or goes wrong in R, it's okay. You can always reload the data using your script. 
</div>
</p></details>


## Give it a name

Everything has a name in R and you can name things almost anything you like. You can even name your data `TOP_SECRET_Shhhhhh...` or `Luke_I_am_your_father` or `the_worst_data_ever`.

Sadly, there are a _few_ minor restrictions. Object names can't include spaces or special characters such as a `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`, `/`, `=`, `!`, or `)`. However, on the plus side object names can include a `_`.

<br>

__Your turn!__  


_Try running some of these examples in your R console. Find new ways to create errors. The more the better!_

```{r, eval = F}

n wookies <- 5

n*wookies <- 5

n_wookies <- 5

n.wookies <- 5


all_the_wookies! <- "Everyone on Kashyyyk"


# You can add one wookie
n_wookies <- n_wookies + 1


# But what if you have 10,000 wookies?
n_wookies <- 10,000


# They also cannot begin with a number.
1st_wookie <- "Chewbacca"

# But they can contain numbers.
wookie1    <- "Chewbacca"

```

<br>


<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue">__EXPLORE:__ _What happened when we created _n_wookies_ the second time?_</summary>
<p>
> When we create a new object that has the same name as something that already exists, the new object replaces the old one. Sometimes we'll want to update an existing object and replace the old version. Other times we may want to copy an object to a new name to preserve the original. This is similar to choosing between _Save_ and _Save As_ when we save a file.

## Multiple items

We can put multiple values inside `c()` to make a vector of items. It's like a chain of items, and each additional item is connected by a comma. The `c` stands for to conCATenate or to combine values into a vector.
  
Let's use `c()` to create a few vectors of names.

```{r vectors}

# Create a character vector and name it starwars_names
starwars_names <- c("Luke", "Leia", "Han Solo")

# Print starwars_names to the console
starwars_names

# Create a numeric vector and name it starwars_ages
starwars_ages  <- c(19,18,25)

# Print the ages to the console
starwars_ages
```


## Make a table

A table in R is known as a __data frame__. We can think of it as a group of columns, where each column is made from a vector. 

![](images/vector_to_dataframe.png){width="510" style="margin-left: 100px;"}

<br>

Data frames in R have columns of data that are all the same length. Let's make a data frame with two columns to hold the names and ages of our characters from above.

<br>

```{r table}

# Create table with columns "names" and "ages" with values from the starwars_names and starwars_ages vectors
starwars_df <- data.frame(names = starwars_names,
                          ages  = starwars_ages)

# Print the starwars_df data frame to the console
starwars_df

```


<br>


### Get values from a `$column_name`  {-}

Use the `$` sign after the name of your table to see the values in one of your columns.

```{r columns}

# View the "ages" column in starwars_df
starwars_df$ages

```


<div class="quiz">

</details>
</div>


## Leave a `#comment`

The text in the scripts with the `#` in front are called comments. A line that starts with a `#` is ignored and won't be run as R code. You can use the `#` to add notes in your script to make it easier for others and yourself to understand what is happening and why. You can also use comments to add warnings or instructions for others using your code.


## Functions


Now that you know what objects are and how to create them, let's learn how to use them in functions. Functions take one or more inputs called "arguments". They perform steps based on the arguments and usually return an output object. 

You can think of a function like a plan for making Clone Troopers.

![](images/clonetrooper_fathead.png){width="220" style="float: left; margin-right: 36px; margin-top: -2px;"}

<br>


```{r, eval=F} 

create_clone(host  = "Jango Fett", 
             modifications = c("accelerated growth", 
                               "absolute loyalty", 
                               "enhanced aggression"), 
             opponents     = "Confederacy of Independent Systems")

```

<br><br>

The function above creates instructions to create Clone Troopers and provides several arguments: `genetic host`, `genetic modifications`, and assumed `opponents`). When we have more than one argument, we use a comma to separate them. With some luck, the function will sucessfully return a new object (an army of Clone Troopers).

<br><br>


### The `sum()` function  {-}

We already covered two functions: `c()` and `data.frame()`. Now let's use the `sum()` function to find the sum age of our Starwars characters.
```{r}

# Call the sum function with starwars_ages as input
ages_sum <- sum(starwars_ages) # Assigns the output to starwars_ages_sum

# Print the starwars_ages_sum value to the console
ages_sum

```

<br>

The `sum()` function takes the _starwars_ages_ vector as input, performs some calculations, and returns a single numeric object. Note that we assigned the output object to the name `ages_sum`. If we don't assign the output object it will be printed to the console and won't be saved. Sometimes this is okay, especially when we're exploring the data. 

```{r}
# Alternative without assigning output
sum(starwars_ages) 
```

<br>


```{r}
starwars_ages
```

> __NOTE:__ Our original `starwars_ages` vector hasn't changed. Each function has its own "environment", and its calculations happen inside a bubble. In general, what happens inside a function won't change objects outside of the function. 



## Function summary {-}

There are functions in R that are more complex, but most boil down to the same general setup:

```{r, eval=F}
new_output <- function(argument_input1, argument_input2)
```

We call the function with input arguments inside parentheses and get an output object in return. You can make your own functions in R and name them almost anything you like, even `my_amazing_starwars_function()`. Naming rules for functions and arguments are the same as those for objects (no spaces or special characters and they can't begin with a number).

#| Reading and loading data
<hr>


The first step of a good scavenger audit is loading some data and figuring out where all the scrap is going. Here's an example data table showing the scrap from Jakku. It is was salvaged from a crash site.

```{r ex-data1, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library("readr")
library("tibble")
library("knitr")

options(scipen = 999)
starwars_scrap <- data.frame(source = c("Coruscant", "Tatooine", "Naboo", "Endor"), destination = c("Jakuu", "Jakuu", "Jakuu", "Jakuu"), item = c("hyperdrives", "datapads", "hyperdrives", "hyperdrives"), quantity = c(3, 100, 45, 1), price = c(300, 25, 45, 10000000))

kable(starwars_scrap)
```

<br>

> __We received a larger scrapper data set from a droid of Crolute Unkar Plutt. But how do we get this data into R?__


## CSV to the rescue 

The main data format in R is the __CSV__ _(comma-separated values)_. A __CSV__ is a simple text file that can be opened in R and most other stats software, including Excel.  

Here's how the example cat table looks when it is saved as a __.CSV__ file. 

__starwars_scrap.csv__  

```
Coruscant Tatooine Naboo Endor
Jakuu Jakuu Jakuu Jakuu
hyperdrives datapads hyperdrives hyperdrives
3 100 45 1
300 25 45 10000000
```

It looks squished together right now, but that's okay. When it's opened in R the text will become a familiar looking table with columns and rows.


## Is your data in a big `.xlsx` file?

<details><summary class = "btn_code_blue"> How to save Excel to a CSV file</summary>
<p>

First, open the Excel cat table by copying this path into a new window or to the Windows search bar  - `X:\Agency_Files\Outcomes\Risk_Eval_Air_Mod\_Air_Risk_Evaluation\R\R_Camp\Intro to R\RCamp - Star Wars\Student Folder\starwars_scrap.xlsx`.


And then follow these instructions to save the Excel file as a _CSV_ file.

- Go to _File_  
- _Save As_  
- _Browse_ to your project folder  
- Create new "data" folder  
- Save as type: _CSV (Comma Delimited) (*.csv)_  
    - Any of the _CSV_ options will work    
- Click __Yes__      
- Close Excel (Click "Don't Save")   

<br>

Now let's check that it worked. Return to RStudio and open your new data folder by finding it in your _Files_ tab in the lower right window. Click on your _CSV_ file and choose __View File__.

<br>

</p></details>



#| Add a new package &#x1F4E6;
<hr>

> __What is a package?__

A _package_ is a small add-on for R like a phone App for your phone. They add capabilities like statistical functions, mapping powers, and special charts. In order to use a new package we first need to install it. 


## _readr_ 

![](https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/9289/medium/1447092171/readr-hexbin-sticker-from-rstudio.png){align="left" width="145" style="margin-right:18px;"}

<br>

The _readr_ package helps import data into R in different formats. It does extra work for you like cleaning the data of extra white space and formatting tricky dates. Your packages are stored in your R _library_. 

<br> <br>

__Add a package to your library__  

1. Open _RStudio_ 
1. Type ` install.packages("readr") ` in the lower left console
1. Press Enter
1. _Wait two seconds_
1. Open the `Packages` tab in the lower right window of RStudio to see the packages in your _library_
    - Use the search bar to find the `readr` package

<br>

The packages tab only shows the available packges that are installed. To use one of them, you will need to load it. Loading a package is like opening an App on your phone. To load a package we need to use the `library()` function. After loading the _readr_ package you will able to read the Star Wars scrap data with the shiny new function `read_csv() `. 


If you want to work with the data in R, you will need to give it a name by using the assignment operator `<-`. 

```{r scrap-csv-readr}
library("readr")

my_scrap_file <- "data/starwars_scrap.csv"

read_csv(my_scrap_file)
```

<br>


## Name your table

If we want to work with the data in R, we'll need to give it a name by using the assignment operator `<-`. 

```{r starwars_csv_name, eval = T}

my_scrap_file <- "data/starwars_scrap.csv"

starwars_scrap <- read_csv(my_scrap_file)

# Type the name of the table to view it in the console
starwars_scrap

```




### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}

You may have noticed the row of three letter abbreviations under the column names. These describe the data type of each column.

> `chr` stands for __character__ vector, or a string of characters. Examples: _"apple"_, _"apple5"_, _"5 red apples"_  
> `int` stands for __integer__. Examples: _5_, _34_, _1071_  
> `dbl` stands for __double__. Examples: _5.0000_, _3.4E-6_, _10.7106_

We'll see more data types, such as `dates` and `logical` (TRUE/FALSE) later on.

</div>




### Function arguments

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue">_What arguments does this function have?_</summary>
<p>


For `read_csv()`, the character object argument _my_scrap_file_ is what the function uses to know where to find the data file. Functions often have more than one argument. Type `?read_csv` into your console to see help in the lower-right pane that describes all of the function's arguments and what they do. Many of the options have default arguments (such as `col_names = TRUE`), which the function will use if you don't provide an alternative argument. A short scroll down in the help window will show you more details about the arguments and the values they take.

> `function(arg1 = input1, arg2 = input2, arg3...)


The _file_ argument tells us that the function expects a path to a file. It can be many types of files, even a _ZIP_ file. Below that, you'll see the _col_names_ argument. This argument takes either `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or a character vector of column names. The default is `TRUE`, which means the first row in the CSV is used as the column names for your data. 

</p></details>

<br>

__Don't like the column names?__ 

We can give new column names to the _col_names_ argument like this:

```{r, message=F}
my_scrap_file <- "data/starwars_scrap.csv"

#Assign desired column names as a character vector named column_names
my_header_names <- c("origin", "final", "thing", "count", "cost")

read_csv(my_scrap_file, col_names = my_header_names)
```



###  Skip a row {-}

We now have the column names we want, but now the original column names in our CSV file show up as a row in our data. We want `read_csv` to ignore the first row. Let's look through the help window and try to find an argument that can help us. The `skip` argument looks like it could be helpful. Sure enough, the description is exactly what we're looking for here. The default is `skip = 0` (read every line), but we can skip the first line by providing `skip = 1`.

```{r, eval = F}
column_names <- c("Name", "Age", "Color")

read_csv(my_cat_file, column_names, skip = 1)

```

<br>


<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue">_Does the order of arguments matter?_</summary>
<p>

You may be wondering why we included `skip =` for the skip argument, but only provided the objects for the other two arguments. When you pass inputs to a function, R assumes you've entered them in the same order that is shown on the ?help page. Let's say you had a function called `feed_pets()` with 3 arguments:

> `feed_pets(dogs = "dogfood", cats = "catnip", fish = "pellets")`.

A shorthand way to write this would be `feed_pets("dogfood", "catnip", "pellets")`. If we write `feed_pets("dogfood", "pellets", "catnip")`, the function will send _fish pellets_ to your cat and _catnip_ to your fish. No good. If you really wanted to write "pellets" second, you would need to tell R which food item belongs to each animal, such as `feed_pets("dogfood", fish = "pellets", cats = "catnip")`.

The same thing goes for `read_csv()`. In `read_csv(my_cat_file, column_names, skip = 1)`, R assumes the file is `my_cat_file` and that the col_names should be set to `column_names`. The `skip =` argument has to be included explicitly because _skip_ is the __10th__ argument in `read_csv()`. If we don't include `skip = `, R assumes the value we entered is meant for the function's __3rd__ argument. 

### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}

A shortcut to see all of a function's arguments is to enter the name of the function in the console and the first parenthesis, such as ` read_csv( `, and then press `TAB` on the keyboard. This brings up a drop-down menu of all the available arguments for that function.
