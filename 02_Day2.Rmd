<summary class="btn_code_blue"> __Day 1 review__ </summary>
<p>

<br>

__1. Load your packages__

__Hint:__ Put the packages you need at the top of every script.

```{r top-packages, eval=F}
library("readr")
library("dplyr")

# Your code starts here
#...

```

<br>

__2. Load data with `read_csv()`__

```{r, eval=F}
my_scrap_data <- "data/starwars_scrap_jakku_full.csv"

scrap <- read_csv(my_scrap_data)

scrap <- filter(scrap, Origin != "All")
```

<br>

<div class="note">
__Read a CSV file using base R__

There’s often more ways than one to solve a puzzle in R. If one way doesn’t work for you data or is moving slowly, there is likely another way to go about things. You don’t always need a package to read CSVs into R. You can also do this in _base_ R with the function `read.csv()`, also known as "read __dot__ csv". 

The code below will also read in the Jakku scrap data file from Day 1.
```{r, eval=F}

data <- read.csv("data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

```

</div>

<br>

__3. `select()` and `arrange()` your data__
```{r select-arrange-review, eval=F}

# Sort from low to high
arrange(scrap, Amount)

# Sort from high to low
arrange(scrap, desc(Amount))

##Select just the Origin cities and Destination (receiving) groups
select(scrap, c(Origin, Dest))

```

<br>


__4. Filter your data with `filter()`__

__Hint:__ Numbers don’t need quotes.

```{r filter-review, eval=F}

# Filter to Salvage items to only those with Amounts of 299
scrap_299 <- filter(scrap, Amount == 299)

# Filter to Salvage items that went to trade caravans and raiders
scrap_trade <- filter(scrap, Dest %in% c("Trade caravan", "Raiders"))

```

<br>

__Questions from Day 1__

- Finding new packages and functions?
    - Use __Cheatsheets__ to find common functions: 
        - Go to _Help_ > _Cheatsheets_. 
        - _Data Transformation_ is what we’re learning now. 
        - _Data Visualization_ is also good. 
    - To search for functions 
        - [google.com](www.google.com): include `r` or `rstats` + `the question`
        - [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12675147/how-can-we-make-xkcd-style-graphs) + use the `[r]` tag
        - To search packages in R get the: [CRANsearcher](https://github.com/RhoInc/CRANsearcher)

- Where’s my _History_?
    - Push the `UP ARROW` in the console to scroll through your recent command history.
    - To view your entire history, select the `History` tab in the upper right next to the `Environment` tab.

- Get function help inside R: `?arrange()`

# Data transformation {-}
<hr>


Let’s calculate some new columns to help prioritize Rey’s scavenging work.


#| `mutate()`
<hr>

`mutate() `can edit existing columns in a data frame or add new columns calculated from the existing data.


## Get to know your data frame {-}

Use these quick functions to describe your data frame.

### Data frame info {-}

| Function          | Information             |  
|:------------------|:------------------------|  
| `names(scrap)`    | column names            |  
| `nrow(scrap)`     | number of rows          |  
| `ncol(scrap)`     | number of columns       | 
| `summary(scrap)`  | summary of all columns  | 
| `glimpse(scrap)`  | column names + a glimpse of first few values (requires loading _dplyr_ package)   |  


## Add a column {-}
<hr>

First let’s add a column with our names, so that Rey will thank us personally on Liberation Day. 
```{r mutate1, echo = T, eval = T}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Get data
scrap <- read_csv("data/starwars_scrap_jakku.csv")

## Add your name as a column
scrap <- mutate(scrap, scrap_finder = "Your name")

```


## Change a column  {-}
<hr>

![](images/starwars_cleandroid.jpg){width="250" style="float:right; margin-top:-4px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 2px;"}

Remember how that unit of Tons was written two ways: "TONS" and "Tons"? We can use `mutate()` together with `tolower()` to make sure all of the Salvage scrap is written in lower case. Case matters in R!

```{r mutate-2}

scrap <- mutate(scrap, Units = tolower(Units))

# toupper() will change all of the letters in a column to upper case.
```


## Add a calculated column {-}
In our work we often use `mutate` to calculate new units for measurements. In this case, let’s estimate the pounds for scavenge items that are reported in tons. 


### Tons to pounds conversions {-}
Use `filter()` to subset the data to the items reported in "tons", and then use `mutate()` to convert the `Amount` column to pounds. We can also change the `Units` column to "pounds" to avoid any confusion.

```{r, eval=F}

scrap_pounds <- filter(scrap, Units == "tons")

scrap_pounds <- mutate(scrap_pounds, 
                       Amount_lbs = Amount * 2000,
                       Units      = "pounds")
```

<br>


I have now written `scrap_pounds` like a million times and I am sick of it. Do I have to type this much? I have rebels to protect and I haven’t eaten in 2 days. 

<br>

### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
> __Error!__  
>`Error in mutate_impl(.data, dots) : `
>
> If you use `mutate()` and provide a single value for a column such as `5`, every row in the new column will have that value. 
>
> If you provide a vector of values, such as `lbs = Amount * 2000`, then a unique value will be calculated for each row. 
>
> An `Error` will occur if you provide a vector that is longer than 1, but has a different length than the number of rows in your data frame. The error message is a helpful reminder that you must provide a vector that is either a single value or the same length as your data frame.



#| The pipe `%>%`

__Use the `%>%` young Padawan.__

![](https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/9302/medium/1447173978/rstudio-hex-pipe-dot-psd.png){width="155" align="left" style="margin-right: 28px;"}

<br>

Luckily, you __don’t__ have to do ALL that typing. The pipe let’s you can chain the `filter()` and `arrange()` functions together and do everything in one go. 

<br><br>

```{r pipe-time}

my_scrap <- scrap %>%
            filter(Salvage == "Acceleration compensator") %>%
            arrange(desc(Amount))

```



#| `left_join()`

Remember our different units issue? 

Well, we don’t want to convert the units one by one. Luckily for us, BB8 found a unit converter table while surfing the web. How does BB8 keep doing that!?

## Get data directly from the interwebs {-}

```{r read-convert}
# The data's url
convert_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MPCA-air/RTrain/master/data/conversion_table.csv"

# Read in the conversion data
convert <- read_csv(convert_url)

head(convert, 3)
```


## Join 2 tables {-}

### `left_join(table1, table2, by = c("columns to join by"))` {-}

<br>

![](images/left_join_image.png){style="width: 85%; max-width: 85%;"}

<br>

```{r join-convert}

# Join the scrap to the conversion table
scrap <- left_join(scrap, convert, by = c("Salvage" = "item"))

head(scrap, 5)
```


<br>

__Help!__ Remeber to type `?left_join` if you are wondering what the arguments are.


#| `ifelse()`
<hr>

Sometimes you may want the value of a new column to depend on the value of an existing column, in other words you want to `mutate()` conditionally. We use `ifelse()` to do this.

### `ifelse(If this is true, "Do this", "Otherwise do this thing")` {-}

<br>
```{r ifelse}

# Convert the Amount to pounds, but only if the units are not already in tons
scrap <- scrap %>% 
         mutate(Ton_Conv = ifelse(Units == 'tons', Amount, 
                                                   Amount * pounds / 2000))

```

<br>

Congratulations of galactic proportions to you. We have a clean and tidy data set. If BB8 receives new data to append, we can re-run this script and in 5 seconds we will have a cleaned up data set again!

## {-}

<br>

We as data analysts often get questions like, What’s the highest number? What’s the lowest number? What is the mean tonnage from Cratertown? So, let us move on to `summarize()`.


#| `summarize()` this
<hr>

![](images/summarize_diagram.png){width="490"}

`summarize()` allows you to apply a summary function like `median()` to a column and collapse your data down to a single row. To really dig into `summarize` you’ll want to know some common summary functions, such as `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `min()`, and `max()`.



## `sum()` {-}

Use `summarize()` and `sum()` to find the total credits from all Salvage.

```{r, eval=T}
summarize(scrap, Total_Credits = sum(Credits))
```


## `mean()` {-}
Use `summarize()` and `mean()` to calculate the _mean_ weight in tons in the Salvage reports.

```{r, eval=T}

summarize(scrap, mean_weight = mean(Ton_Conv, na.rm = T))

```

<br>

> Note the `na.rm = TRUE` in the `mean()` function. This tells R to ignore empty cells or missing values that show up in R as `NA`. If you leave `na.rm` out, the _mean_ funciton will return 'NA' when it finds a missing value in the data.


## `median()` {-}
Use summarize to calculate the _median_ weight in the Salvage reports.

`summarize(scrap, median_price = median(Ton_Conv, na.rm = T))`

## `max()` {-}
Use summarize to calculate the _maximum_ price per ton any scrapper got for their Salvage.

`summarize(scrap, max_price = max(Price_per_Ton, na.rm = T))`

## `min()` {-}
Use summarize to calculate the _minimum_ price per ton any scrapper got for their Salvage.

`summarize(scrap, min_price = min(Price_per_Ton, na.rm = T))`

## `nth()` {-}
Use `summarize()` and `nth(Origin, 12)` to find the name of the Origin City that got the  _12th_ highest scrapper haul.   

_Hint: Use `arrange()` first._

`arrange(scrap, desc(Ton_Conv)) %>% summarize(price_12 = nth(Origin, 12))`

## `sd()` {-}

What is the _standard deviation_ of the credits?

`summarize(scrap, stdev_Credits = sd(Credits))`

## `quantile()` {-}

_Quantiles_ are useful for finding the upper or lower range of a column. Use the `quantile()` function to find the the 5th and 95th quantile of the prices.

```{r quants, eval = FALSE}

summarize(scrap, 
          price_5th_pctile  = quantile(Price_per_Ton, 0.05, na.rm = T),
          price_95th_pctile = quantile(Price_per_Ton, 0.95))
```

_Hint: add `na.rm = T` to `quantile()`._


## `n()` {-}

`n()` stands for _count_.

Use summarize and `n()` to count the number of reported Salvage records going to a Niima outpost. 

_Hint: Use `filter()` first._  

```{r}
filter(scrap, Dest == "Niima Outpost") %>% summarize(salvage_records = n())
```

<br>


### <i class="fa fa-starwars" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Create a summary of the scrap data that includes 3 of the summary functions above. 

```{r, eval=F}

summary <- summarize(scrap, 
                     max_credits      = __________,
                     weight_90th_pct  = quantile(Weight, 0.90),
                     count_records    = __________,
                     
```



#| `group_by()`
<hr>

> Wouldn’t it be nice if we could easily find the mean price at every Origin City? It’s time for `group_by()`!

<br>

Let’s use `group_by` with the column _Origin_ again, but this time use `summarize` to find the `mean(Price_per_Ton)` for each Origin City. 

```{r mean_price-by-origin}

scrap_summary <- group_by(scrap, Origin) %>% 
                 summarize(mean_price =  mean(Price_per_Ton, na.rm = T)) 

```


<br>


<details><summary class="btn_code"> Rounding digits </summary><p>

You can round the prices to a certain number of digits using the `round()` function. We can finish by adding the `arrange()` function to sort the table by our new column.

```{r mean_price-by-Origin-round}

scrap_means <- group_by(scrap, Origin) %>% 
                 summarize(mean_price       =  mean(Price_per_Ton, na.rm = T),
                           mean_price_round = round(mean_price, digits = 2)) %>%  
                 arrange(mean_price_round) %>%
                 ungroup()

```

<br>

__NOTE:__ The `round()` function in R does not automatically round values ending in 5 up, instead it uses scientific rounding. It rounds values ending in 5 to the nearest even number, so 2.5 rounded to the nearest whole number using `round()` is 2, and 3.5 rounded to the nearest whole number is 4. If you want to round all values ending in 5 up, then you’ll have to use a rounding function from another package.

</p></details>


<br>

Try using `group_by` with the column _Origin_ and then use `summarize` to count the number of Salvage reports from each city.  

```{r grp-by-origin, eval = FALSE}

scrap_counts <- group_by(scrap, Origin) %>% 
                summarize(origin_count  =  n()) %>% 
                ungroup()

```


<br>

### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
> Ending with `ungroup()` is good practice. This will prevent your data from staying grouped after the summarizing has been completed.



#| Save files
<hr>

Let’s save the mean price summary table we created to a _CSV_. That way we can print it to have it __transmitted through Droid courier__ to Rey. To save a data frame we’ll use the `write_csv()` function from our favorite _readr_ package. 
```{r, eval = F}

# Write the file to your results folder
write_csv(scrap_means, "results/Mean_prices_by_origin.csv")

```



### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
> __Warning!__ By default, R will overwrite a file if the file already exists in a folder. It will not ask for confirmation. To be safe, do not save processed data to your `data\` folder.
>

<br>


#| Grouped `mutate()` 
<br><hr>

We can bring back `mutate` to add a column based on the grouped values in a data set. For example, you may want to add a column showing the mean price by country to the whole table.  

When you combine `group_by` and `mutate` the new column will be calculated based on the values within each group. 

```{r mutate-price, eval=F}

group_by(scrap, Origin) %>% mutate(origin_mean_price = mean(Price_per_Ton, na.rm = T)) %>% ungroup()

```

<br>

Let’s visualize the data with some more plots.


#| Make a `ggplot()` sandwich
<hr>

![](images/auto_plot.gif){style="float: right; margin-top: -20px; width: 105%;"}


## The 3 ingredients of a `ggplot` {-}

### 1. The base plot {-}
```{r, echo=F}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
ggplot(scrap)
```

<br>

> Note when we load the package it’s `library ("ggplot2")`, but the function to make a plot is `ggplot(scrap)`. We admit, it is a bit silly.


### 2. The the X, Y _(aesthetics)  {-}
The _aesthetics_ assign the components from the data you want to use in the chart. These also determine the dimensions of the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = Dest, y = Credits)) 
```


### 3. The layers or _geometries_  {-}
```{r}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = Dest, y = Credits)) + geom_point()
```

<br>


#### <i class="fa fa-starwars" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Try making a scatterplot of any two columns.

_Hint: Numeric variables will be more informative._

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = __column1__, y = __column2__)) + geom_point()
```

## Colors {-}
<hr>


Now let’s use color to show the origins of the scrap
```{r}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = Dest, y = Credits, color = Origin)) +
  geom_point()
```


This is a too much detail. Let’s make a bar chart and add up the sales to make it easier to understand.
```{r}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = Dest, y = Credits, fill = Origin)) + geom_bar(stat = "sum")
```


What if we want to make it easier to compare sales by origin? Let’s change the position:
```{r}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = Dest, y = Credits, fill = Origin)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "sum", position = "dodge")
```


# Homeworld training {-}

1. Load one of the data sets below into R
    - Porg contamination: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MPCA-air/RTrain/master/data/Porg_samples.csv`
    - Endor air samples: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MPCA-air/RTrain/master/data/air_endor.csv`
    - Or use data from a recent project of yours
2. Create 2 types of plots using the data. _Don’t worry if it looks really-really weird. Consider it art._
3. Paste the function `runif(1)` into your console. 
    - If the number you get is bigger than `0.2` e-mail your charts to the rest of the class.
